A better way to have done this would have been having a dedicated <audio> tag for each sound and repeat those. I didn't do this because my computer had a bug where it wouldn't rewind all the way even if I set the time to one. I had to reload it and this got the best result. After seeing the video I have modified my solution so it deletes and adds the audio tag in a specified div. It now works a lot better when going between sounds but the lag still renders this unplayable. but it works, so yeah.
