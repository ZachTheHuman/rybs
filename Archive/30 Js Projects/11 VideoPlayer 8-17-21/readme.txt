This took me a much longer to make than any of the other projects, it was fun but it was incredibly hard. There are still some 
features I chose to cut in the intrest of actually finishing it eventually, things like css transtions when you hover and click 
things and a settings button that gives you access to playback speed, I was going to add a image-quality option that would swap
out the video with a 780p or a 240p or a 1080p, etc. A ton of things I could have added, maybe eventually I could have figured 
out a subtitles system but I have 20 other things to do and that's just this part of the module. 

tl;dr: Feature creep kills, man.
