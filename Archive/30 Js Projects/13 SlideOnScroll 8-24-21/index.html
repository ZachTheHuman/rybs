        Extreme ironing is an extreme sport in which people take ironing boards
        to remote locations and iron items of clothing. According to the Extreme
        Ironing Bureau, extreme ironing is "<i
          >the latest danger sport that combines the thrills of an extreme
          outdoor activity with the satisfaction of a well-pressed shirt.</i
        >"
      </p>
      <p>
        Part of the attraction and interest the media has shown towards extreme
        ironing seems to center on the issue of whether it is really a sport or
        not. It is widely considered to be tongue-in-cheek.

        Some other locations where such performances have taken place include a
        mountainside of a difficult climb; a forest; in a canoe; while skiing or
        snowboarding; on top of large bronze statues; in the middle of a street;
        underwater; in the middle of the M1 motorway race; whilst parachuting;
        and under the ice sheet of a frozen lake. The performances have been
        conducted solo or by groups.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Extreme ironing was invented by Tony Hiam in 1980, near Settle in the
        Yorkshire Dales National Park in England. Inspired by his eccentric
        brother in law, John Slater, who ironed his clothes even when camping in
        a tent, Tony illustrated the futility of unnecessary ironing by doing it
        in bizarre situations such as mountain-lookouts, crowded airport
        departure lounges, on top of telephone kiosks and charity clothing bins.
        Until 1990 Tony often carried ironing board plus iron in his car-boot,
        on the lookout for opportunities to cause bystanders to glance twice,
        thinking: "Did I really see that?" Some purists of the sport, apparently
        unaware of its early origin, claim that it was started later in 1997 in
        Leicester, England, by resident Phil Shaw in his back garden. Shaw came
        home from what he recalls as a hard day in a Leicester knitwear factory.
        Shaw had a number of chores to do, including ironing his shirts.
        Preferring the idea of an evening out rock climbing, he decided to
        combine the two activities into a new extreme sport. In June 1999, Shaw,
        who uses the nickname "Steam", embarked on an international tour to
        promote the activity. The stops included the United States, Fiji, New
        Zealand, Australia and South Africa. An encounter with German tourists
        in New Zealand led to the formation of a group called "Extreme Ironing
        International", and the German Extreme Ironing Section or GEIS. This has
        yet to popularize in North America.

        As extreme ironing has branched off, the conditions can gain in extreme
        activity. For example, a branch of ironing has been developed that
        includes both bungee jumping and well-pressed clothing. Bungee ironing
        is what some would call the ultimate in the thrill of extreme ironing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sport gained international attention in 2003 after a documentary
        entitled <i>Extreme Ironing: Pressing for Victory</i>, was produced for
        Britain's Channel 4 by Wag TV. The program followed the British team's
        efforts and eventual Bronze and Gold placings in the 1st Extreme Ironing
        World Championships in Germany. A side-story looked at the rivalry
        between the EIB (Extreme Ironing Bureau) and a breakaway group called
        Urban Housework who were trying to establish their own extreme sport
        based around vacuum-cleaning. The film later aired on the National
        Geographic Channel.

      <h3>In Pop Culture</h3>
      <p>
        The activity rose high enough in the zeitgeist to land an appearance on
        the long-running soap opera EastEnders. The 2 August 2004 episode
        featured a reference to the then-current altitude record holders the Hot
        Plate Brothers. As the party-loving Kat and Zoe Slater are preparing to
        go out, they are invited to the launch party at Angie's Den where
        celebrities - including the brothers - are supposed to appear.
